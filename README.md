# Segmentation-Self-Driving-Cars

Task : Task was to perform semantic segmentation on a dataset similar to cityscapes.

Model Used : I used U-net kind of architecture to achieve the segmentation . The network is called Xception Unet which is computationally less expensive as compared to regular      Unet model.

Scope for Improvement : 1. Reduce overfitting
                        2. Add Temporal consistency.
